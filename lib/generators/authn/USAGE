Description:
  This will generate the configuration file (should you need it) to
  modify AuthN's configuration.

Examples:
  rails generate authn:config

    This will generate an commented-out config file. Change and update if
    you need to. AuthN doesn't require this config file to exist.

  rails generate authn:config --model SomeUserModel

    This generates the config file but with a specific model in for the
    default "User" model. Default Value: Account
